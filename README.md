# Java-Snippets
A repo dedicated to housing all the useful snippets collected throughout the duration of the programming bootcamp 1 course.

usage for the snippets would be to see the use cases for certain topics such as methods or nested loops, or to see how to do a specific thing like binary searches or selection sorting (found in the algorithms folder).

I will continue to update the repository with more snippets (depending on what chapter i am at)  as we progress through the chapters and if you have a github account, you too could contribute some snippets as well!
